<ul>
	<li>Pomf does NOT support Internet Explorer and older versions of Firefox, Chrome, Opera and Safari.</li>
	<li>Uploading tools for Pomf can be found at <a href="tools.html">Tools</a>.</li>
	<li>Max file size is 50MiB, hopefully I won't have to change this to a even lower number. (read: don't be an ass).</li>
	<li>No Child porn, anything else goes until I get a lawsuit I guess. (unless its a virus, because that goes into the being an ass category).</li>
	<li>All filetypes are allowed, ALL! (gif,exe,jpg,rar,ass,srt,etc,etc).</li>
	<li>Any file can be removed or replaced at any time for any reason.</li>
	<li>No logs are kept, no logs over uploading nor over downloading. This can be temp enabled to stop certain spamming (read: child porn or such).</li>
	<li>a/i/pomf.se is hosted as for now on 500mbit server and Cloudflare's CDN helps out a lot, I'm on a restrained budget and this costs a lot so please don't be an ass.</li>
	<li>I want to deliver the best free service I can without ads or such so donations are very welcome via the donate button on the front page (pomf.se).</li>
	<li>Viruses will be removed if detected most of the time, this is to not cause further damage in form of i/a/pomf.se ending up on blacklists and whatnot. (read: IT ALREADY FUCKING IS!).</li>
	<li>For removal of a file or such contact me at neku@pomf.se or pixel@pomf.se</li>
	<li>We also have a mail newsletter thingy which you can sign-up at <a href="http://t.co/AyrLb4GWfO" TARGET="_BLANK">here!</a></li>
</ul>
